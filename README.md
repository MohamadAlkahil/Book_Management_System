# Book Management System 
## Overview
The database schema provides the structure for storing and managing information related to users, orders, publishers, books, genres, book-genre associations, and user feedback. It ensures data integrity through primary keys, foreign key constraints, and unique constraints. The schema serves as the foundation for the functionality of the Java-based database query application. The command-line application allows users to retrieve specific information from the database, such as book ratings, author details, book prices, and more, based on their query selections.
